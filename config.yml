#### G.W.E.N. Config
#
# NOTE: Most of the values here have been tried and tested to work.
#       It is not recommended that you change them unless you are
#       getting false positives.
#
#		It would be a good idea to make sure the false positives you're getting aren't actually hackers....
#
#
# The configurable commands will replace "{player}" with the name of the player. Multiple commands should be seperated by a ';'
# e.g: kick {player} Hacking;broadcast {player} is a haxor
#
#      will run:
#         kick {player} Hacking
#         broadcast {player} is a haxor
#
## If you need any help configuring G.W.E.N., or you're getting false positives and you don't know why, feel free to PM me on Spigot.
